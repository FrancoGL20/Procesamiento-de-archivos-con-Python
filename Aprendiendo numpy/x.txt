Parameters

- **axis**: {0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’, None}, default 0
	
	Indicate which axis or axes should be reduced. For Series this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.

0 / ‘index’ : reduce the index, return a Series whose index is the original column labels.

1 / ‘columns’ : reduce the columns, return a Series whose index is the original index.

None : reduce all axes, return a scalar.

- **bool_only**: bool, default False
	
	Include only boolean columns. Not implemented for Series.

- **skipna**: bool, default True
	
	Exclude NA/null values. If the entire row/column is NA and skipna is True, then the result will be True, as for an empty row/column. If skipna is False, then NA are treated as True, because these are not equal to zero.

- ****kwargs**: any, default None
	
	Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for compatibility with NumPy.

- **Returns**: Series or DataFrame
	
	If level is specified, then, DataFrame is returned; otherwise, Series is returned.
